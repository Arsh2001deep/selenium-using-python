the file demo.py is used to submit few details and then re writting the urls ,which are printed on the output.txt file which are:-

links,title,content,tags
then submit it one one website 
make changes in the url to using loops to create a submission link for every site 
  
  
  
instead of rewritting the url ,we can submit on each and every website using loops (which demonstrated in the forum.py ) but it will take more time.
